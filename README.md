# My Personal Website

To showcase my Software Development skills I have decided to build my Personal Website with my favourite framework, Django.
The website will feature a few different elements:

* Resume/CV section containing:
    1. Work Experience
    2. Education
    3. Technical Skills
    4. Certifications

* Contact page with all the ways to get in touch with me.
* Personal Blog
* Portfolio highlighting some of my favourite projects
